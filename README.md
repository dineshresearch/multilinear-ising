Code associated with Concentration of Multilinear Functions of the Ising Model with Applications to Network Data, by [Constantinos Daskalakis](http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/), [Nishanth Dikkala](http://people.csail.mit.edu/nishanthd/), and [Gautam Kamath](http://www.gautamkamath.com/).

To run processMusic.m, one requires the [HetRec 2011](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/) dataset.
This involves extracting [hetrec2011-lastfm-2k.zip](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec2011/hetrec2011-lastfm-2k.zip) to the directory multilinear-ising/data.

Figures from the paper can be generated by running the following files:
Figure 1: visualize.m.
Figure 2: syntheticExperiment.m. Loads a precomputed set of MCMC statistics, which can be regenerated by running syntheticPrecomputeStats.m
Figure 3 and 4: processMusic.m. Requires uncommenting the relevant lines in the script.
